# Need a hero

## Basic info

 * The basic idea of this project is to provide a quick and easy reference to compare heroes.
 * First target game is Overwatch, but in theory this could be applied to other hero based games as well
   - VALORANT
   - DOTA2
   - League of Legends
   - etc
 * Ideally this project will find a balance between function and complexity, if you are trying to build meta-team comps or theory craft this is likely not the tool for you

## Contributing

 * hopefully the layout is pretty obvious of how to get stuff working
 * current not an enforced system to schema, have to just stay consistent manually
 * a lot of these rating are subjective, so community feedback is certainly welcome
